# restaurant_page
A restaurant page that makes use of webpack and NPM Node modules for controlling entry and output. It uses JavaScript to generate
all the page content and to handle switching between each "tab" content. In this project I became comfortable with Webpack to handle bundling all 
my source files and NPM modules. I made use on webpacks-dev-server and watch mode during the development process to allow to see changes live without having to run build and reload the page after every change.
